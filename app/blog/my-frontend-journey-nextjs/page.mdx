# My Frontend Journey with Next.js

Before I understood frameworks, I was writing plain HTML and CSS, sometimes copying React code without really understanding it. But everything changed when I met **Next.js**. Not the modern one with fancy `app/` routing â€” the old-school Next.js with `pages/` and limited built-in features.

---

## First Encounter: Classic Next.js (Pre v13)

I started with an older version of Next.js. At that time:

- No `app/` directory
- File-based routing only via `pages/`
- No nested layouts
- API routes were cool, but limited

It still felt easier than setting up a full React project with webpack. The SSR feature and automatic routing system were super helpful. Even though I didnâ€™t fully understand React concepts like `useEffect` or `useState`, I kept trying â€” breaking things and rebuilding.

> Next.js felt like the training wheels that I actually enjoyed keeping on.

I used it to build portfolios, landing pages, and clone projects. Sometimes I got stuck, but that made the wins more satisfying.

## Discovering App Router in v13

Then one day, I heard about **Next.js 13**. Everything changed.

- A new folder called `app/`
- File-based **layouts** and **nested routes**
- React Server Components (!)
- Loading UI with `loading.tsx`
- Parallel routes and intercepting routes

It was a lot. At first, it confused me. But I kept learning. Reading the new docs, watching tutorials, testing layouts. Slowly, the puzzle made sense.

```tsx
// Old Pages Router;
;/pages/deinx.tsx /
  pages /
  about.tsx /
  // New App Router
  app /
  page.tsx /
  app /
  about /
  page.tsx /
  app /
  layout.tsx
```

That difference was huge. App Router made it feel like I had more control over how the page works â€” especially with layouts and loading states.

## Becoming Obsessed with Next.js

Once I understood the App Router, I got really into it:

- I followed every Vercel release note
- I started reading changelogs for every version
- I joined the Next.js Discord and GitHub discussions

Next.js became more than a tool â€” it became something I was proud to understand.

## Using It in Real Projects

Now I use it for everything:

- **Portfolio Sites**: Fast loading, SEO-friendly
- **Blog Platforms**: MDX integration, dynamic routing
- **Web3 Dashboards**: Server functions + React state

My stack has also evolved:

- **Deployment**: Vercel for frictionless shipping
- **Styling**: Tailwind + shadcn/ui for clean UI
- **Prototyping**: v0.dev for fast iteration

## What I Learned from This Journey

Frontend isnâ€™t just about pretty buttons. Itâ€™s about architecture, performance, UX, and developer experience. Next.js helped me understand how to:

- Structure real apps
- Think in components
- Handle async and SSR cleanly
- Love debugging (sometimes ðŸ˜…)

## Advice to New Devs

If you're just starting:

- Start with the basics â€” donâ€™t skip `pages/` router history
- Learn why App Router exists and how it works
- Build real apps: not just tutorials
- Be curious â€” the docs, changelogs, and GitHub issues are gold

Frontend keeps evolving. But for me, it all started with that first `pages/index.tsx` and a confusing Next.js starter template. And that moment â€” when it all finally clicked â€” thatâ€™s when I knew: **I want to keep building.**
