# Leveling Up with Vercel, shadcn/ui & v0.dev

Once I understood the basics, I started looking for ways to build faster and prettier.

## ðŸ§ª Vercel for Deployment

One command, instant preview links, and GitHub integration. It made pushing projects feel professional.

## ðŸŽ¨ shadcn/ui for Styling

I was tired of ugly UIs or copy-pasting components from blogs. `shadcn/ui` gave me:

- Tailwind-compatible components
- Full design freedom
- Accessibility and scalability

## âœ¨ v0.dev for Prototyping

Itâ€™s like co-building with an AI. Iâ€™d describe a layout and get code â€” fast.

> These tools helped me stop struggling and start shipping.
