# Bringing It All Together in Web3

With my frontend stack solid, I finally felt ready to build Web3 apps.

## What I Used

- **Next.js** for SSR and page routing
- **Vercel** for deployment
- **shadcn/ui** for beautiful components
- **ethers.js + wagmi** for blockchain connection
- **RainbowKit** for wallet UX

## My First dApp

It was a basic NFT viewer + marketplace. But I built it with confidence — no longer stuck Googling every button.

## Lesson: Web3 Frontends Need Good UX

Even if the backend is decentralized, the UI needs to be familiar, fast, and clean.

> That’s where this stack shines.
