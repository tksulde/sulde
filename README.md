# Suldeâ€™s Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal website and portfolio â€” built with the latest stack:  
**Next.js 15**, **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Motion-Primitives** for delightful animations.

I designed this site as a **minimal and modern portfolio** for developers, designers, and founders.  
It combines clean aesthetics with smooth animated components, making personal branding effortless.
